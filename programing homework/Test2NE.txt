Write a program that reads the contents of a file that contains a list of numbers. After all of the numbers have been read, the program should display a message indicating the largest and smallest numbers in the list. It should also display the average of all of the numbers. You will also write this output to a file.
I have attached the input file Numbers.txt that contains the list of numbers.
Please make sure to upload both your source code (.java file) and output file (.txt file).
